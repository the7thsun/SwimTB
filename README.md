# SwimTB
The discord bot for SwimClan
please remember that this is one of my first projects in Java
and is my first project that is anything more than a calculator

it might not work anymore, it was buggy af when it was running on MysticLobby and if you want to run it yourself feel free to torture yourself
(one thing i do know is **"jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT).setToken("").build();"** will not work you will have to update the way the bot will log in)
i would do that myself but i want to keep this as a point of refrence for my codeing skill in the future so i want to chage it as little as possible

i did refactor it to remove parts of the old application bot that were part of it but that *sholdent* efect any of the tournament stuff

also it uses https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA
